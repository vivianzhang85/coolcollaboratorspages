# Queue
Assignment Queue allows users and teachers to facilitate live reviews in a scrum based classroom easily. Instead of lining up, students use the feature to indicate they are ready to present. Teachers use the queue to see who is next to present and who still has not presented. The feature allows students to simply remain at their desks and continue working during live reviews.
## [Teacher View](https://spring.opencodingsociety.com/mvc/assignments/queue-management) - Usage
Upon entering the page, a modal prompts for an assignment (see assignment table documentation). Teachers should choose the assignment that they want to view.

Teachers should
 - Select and Assignment
 - Specify a presentation length
 - Select the groups that will present (see groups database documentation)
 - Specify whether presentations are individual or in groups.
Teachers can click the being presentations button to add users/groups to the working list.
The queue stores all positions in case reviews take longer than one session.
To reset the queue, use the reset button.
