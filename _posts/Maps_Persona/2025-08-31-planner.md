bio: >
  I am an organized CS student who excels at planning, tracking, and communicating with my team. I champion process management and issue tracking, and I am motivated by seeing a comprehensive plan come together. I gain satisfaction from seeing projects that are working and highly functional. Sometimes, I struggle to balance planning with hands-on technical work, especially when there is a lot to organize or integrate.
