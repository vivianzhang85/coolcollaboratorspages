**What is it?**
The page allows students to create grade requests for other students' submissions.

**Role of this Webpage**
This page facilitates two activities: peer grading and team teaches. On certain assignments, teachers may wish to allow students to grade each others' work. This can be done by assigning random graders for the submissions on the teacher page for assignments, and then the students will see the assignment on this page. If they click the "view submissions" button for the assignment, they will see the submission and be able to assign a numerical grade and be asked to explain why they gave that grade. Any students who are teaching a team teach will be able to see all the submissions for that assignment when they click the "view submissions" button. When students assign a grade from this inferface, the grades are not directly inputted. Instead, a grade request is created that must be manually approved by the teacher to go into the gradebook.

**Interaction With Other Features**
This webpage primarily works with grading and assignments: it creates grade requests that the teacher can approve oor reject and it shows submissions from assignments that the student is meant to grade.
