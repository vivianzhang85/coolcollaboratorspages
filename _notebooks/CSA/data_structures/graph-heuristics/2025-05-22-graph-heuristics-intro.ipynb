    "\n",
    "Graph heuristics are **estimation-based strategies** used to solve graph problems efficiently when finding an exact solution would be computationally expensive or time-consuming. Unlike traditional algorithms that guarantee optimal solutions, heuristics prioritize speed and practicality by making educated guesses about the best path forward.\n",

    "### **Key Concept: Heuristic = Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A heuristic function  estimates the cost or distance from a current state to the goal. It doesn't guarantee accuracy but provides a reasonable approximation to guide decision-making.\n",
