## Home Page, Blog, and Issue

Teacher and Peer evaluation are critical to our success and improvements.  

1. The Home Page on your personal Blog should be a place to discuss your personal projects and progress.
2. Be sure to share your progress through Big Idea 1 & 3 by updating you Blog.
3. Class Presentations by Lesson and by Comprehension solidfy our study.
4. Issues can be used to showcase meeting objective and recive feedback through Utterance Comments.

## Student Teaching - Part 1 Fundamentals Blog

Students will engage in lesson preparation, teaching, and grading. This activity is often called "Team Teach". The process and purpose are as follows:

1. Learn Big Idea 1 & 3 from the College Board.  As well as required video making skills.
2. Build a lesson using Python and JavaScript for each of the programming fundamentals provided by the teacher's starters.  Better if it is related to a real project.
3. The lesson should include a Tech Talk portion, video portion, popcorn hacks, and homework hacks. The lesson should NOT have more than 5 minutes of talking before engaging students in an activity (e.g., popcorn hacks).
4. Be prepared to grade homework. This means having a plan for homework and a plan for grading the homework. You will grade on a "1-point" scale. Weight popcorn hacks and homework hacks in your grading.
5. Lesson time will be in minute breakdwons as follows 20 lesson - 20 application - 20 review/submit. We are looking for a 5 minutes of video in lesson time.

### Lesson Building

#### Grading Guideline

- 55% is minimum per item
- 75% is mostly done
- 85% is complete
- 90% is maximum perfection

### Lesson Review - Topic Relevancy (Student Review)

Self Grade checklist.  Scurm Master should coordinate.

Note 1. **The purpose is NOT MORPH lessons to be the same, boring!!!**
Note 2. **Student reviewers will be evaluated on how and if you perform a review**
Note 3. **Student lesson providers will be evaluated if the improve lesson based off of feedback.  Remebmer/document your changes**

## Enrichment Presentation to Class

The focus should be on how you were enriched in both technical and soft skills.

### Guideline

This is a guideline of focus; consider these 4 things when you talk individually:

- **Blog**: In association with Big Ideas and Teaching, discuss something that shows how you will be prepared for CB and PBL activities in the future (e.g., an organized checklist of accomplishments).
- **Memory**: Consider something that will help the teacher and fellow students recall your individual presentation and contribution (e.g., a highlight of your lesson).
- **Relevancy**: Describe something impactful you learned from another lesson, note the source, and try to use the relevancy checklist language in your discussion (e.g., a learning experience).
- **Beyond Perfunctory**: Inform listeners of something that shows them that this Sprint on Big Idea 3 is distinctly yours (e.g., personal growth or accomplishment).

## Sprint 2 Big Idea 3 Final

Every student needs to update their blog to be reflective of accomplishments and learning from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.  This will be focus of Live Review.

1. **Sprint 1**: As we move to Project-based Learning task the Teacher needs to be convinced all tools are working.  The most important things to certify:  VSCode localhost build, GitHub Pages github.io link, Analytics, VSCode roll forward/roll back.

2. **Sprint 2**: Using the Final Hack or similar, show teacher as single place that all the BI Unit 3 elements homeworks come together.  The expectation is something visual and in JavaScript.

3. **Home Page**: Using ideaas from Open Coding Socity Pages blogging style update your home page to be reflective of your year long progress in the class.
