    "A **stack** is a **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** data structure.  \n",

    "### **Stack Operations:**\n",
    "- **push(item)**: Add an item to the top of the stack.\n",
    "- **pop()**: Remove an item from the top of the stack.\n",

    "## **üìå How Can We Use Stacks and Queues for a Calculator?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using a Stack in a Calculator:**\n",
    "Stacks are ideal for evaluating mathematical expressions, particularly those in **postfix** notation (Reverse Polish Notation), where operators follow operands. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to Evaluate Postfix Expression using Stack:**\n",
    "1. **Read the expression** from left to right.\n",
    "2. If an **operand** (number) is encountered, **push it onto the stack**.\n",
    "3. If an **operator** is encountered, **pop two operands** from the stack, apply the operator, and **push the result back onto the stack**.\n",
    "4. Continue this process until the end of the expression.\n",
    "5. The **final result** will be the only value left in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:** `5 3 + 4 *`\n",
    "1. Push `5` ‚Üí Stack: `[5]`\n",
    "2. Push `3` ‚Üí Stack: `[5, 3]`\n",
    "3. Encounter `+`: Pop `3` and `5`, calculate `5 + 3 = 8`, push `8` ‚Üí Stack: `[8]`\n",
    "4. Push `4` ‚Üí Stack: `[8, 4]`\n",
    "5. Encounter `*`: Pop `4` and `8`, calculate `8 * 4 = 32`, push `32` ‚Üí Stack: `[32]`\n",
    "6. **Final result:** `32`\n",

    "### **Using a Queue in a Calculator:**\n",
    "Queues are less commonly used for direct arithmetic calculations but can be useful in simulating processes like order of operations or handling multiple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a queue could be used in a **multi-step calculator** where tasks (like addition, subtraction, etc.) are added to the queue, and the system processes them in the order they were received.\n",

    "## **üí° Example: Using a Stack for Infix to Postfix Conversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps can be used to convert an infix expression (like `3 + 5 * 2`) to postfix notation using a stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize an empty stack**.\n",
    "2. **Process the infix expression** from left to right.\n",
    "3. If a **number** is encountered, add it to the output expression.\n",
    "4. If an **operator** is encountered, pop operators from the stack and add them to the output expression until an operator with lower precedence is found.\n",
    "5. **Push the current operator** onto the stack.\n",
    "6. At the end of the expression, pop any remaining operators in the stack and add them to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Infix: `3 + 5 * 2`\n",
    "- Postfix: `3 5 2 * +`\n",
