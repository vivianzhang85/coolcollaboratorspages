    keyPoints:
      - "Collaborate in real-time with the snake game"
      - "Establish ceremonies in the team"
      - "Share and collaboorate on knowledge"
    subtitle: "Snake Game"
    description: "Snake is a genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens."
