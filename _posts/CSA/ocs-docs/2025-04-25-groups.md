### What is it?
The groups creation page is a way to organize students into groups based on features, table assignments, or any other criteria. It shows what groups exist along with the period they are in.
### How to use it?
After logging into the Java page on Open Coders, navigate to the Student Toolkit page and then click on the Groups tab to use the groups feature.
#### Creation
Make a name and a period for the group you want to create (Group period can be left as null if students are in different periods). Then, use the list of people to select who you want to add to the group. Finally, click the create group button to make the group.
### Group Page

### Usage
View Members Button: Pops up a small table under the group that shows all users in the group (as seen in the image).

Edit Button: Shows a popup that has a list of all users. Can be used to add more users into groups or remove existing users.


### Admin Usage
The admin view of the groups page is very similar with the frontend view of the page, but the page shows all of the existing groups and there is a delete button that can be used to delete any group.
