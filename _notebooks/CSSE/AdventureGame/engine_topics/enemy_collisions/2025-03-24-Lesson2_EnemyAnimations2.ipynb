    "## What Are Death / Enemy Animations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Death animations are features in a game where when the player dies, there is an animation that plays instead of a simple alert letting the player know that they died. For example, in Minecraft, the player turns red and falls to the side when they are killed. In Mario, he jumps back before falling into the ground when he is killed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enemy animations are similar to death animations, but it happens to the enemy instead. For example, the animation in Minecraft where the creeper starts charging up before it explodes and such."

    "## Why Death / Enemy Animations are important \n",
    "\n",
    "Death animations are important in the game especially with the addition of enemies that the player has to avoid. It will siginify when the player had not completed the goal of avoiding the enemy. In our example, we have a creeper moving that the player has to avoid inorder to get to places in the game. Adding death animations creates and imersive experience for the player and gives a challenge to make the game more engaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by first telling the game by checking if the player collides with the sprite. In the previous lesson, we talked about how we created our own `Enemy.js` file for the enemies in the game. Using this file, we can create specific enemies extending from the main file. In our example, we created a `Creeper.js` file that's special to the creeper."

    "The enemy exploding \n",
    "- Instead of making the player explode, it may be a better idea for the enemy to explode instead. But then, there would need to be a way to know that the player took damage and died. \n",
    "\n",
    "Player jump back \n",
    "- In games like Mario, there is a small animation where Mario bounces back from the collided enemy before dying. Something like that could be added into the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player turn red \n",
    "- Like in the actual Minecraft game, when players are damaged, they turn a shade of red for a moment before returning to moment. This could be another animation that happens when collided with the enemy \n",

    "Enemy sprite changes \n",
    "- While it could be fun to animate the explosion affect on the enemy, there could also be a way for the enemy png to change when collided with the player. For example, the Creeper sprite could change into a png of an explosion when collided with the player."
