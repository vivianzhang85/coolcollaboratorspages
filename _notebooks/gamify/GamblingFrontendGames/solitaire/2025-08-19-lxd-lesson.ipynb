    "## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Understand the core principles of LxD (empathy, context, narrative, interaction).\n",
    "- Analyze an AP CSA topic and identify learner needs.\n",
    "- Design an LxD lesson outline that makes the topic engaging and accessible.\n",
    "- Prototype at least one interactive element for their lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2Ô∏è‚É£ AP CSA Context\n",
    "We‚Äôll center this activity around an AP CSA topic ‚Äî e.g., Array Algorithms or Inheritance & Polymorphism ‚Äî but the meta-goal is teaching how to teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Teaching Aids\n",
    "**Visual**: Diagrams showing LxD pillars & design cycle (Empathize ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Refine).\n",
    "**Templates**: Lesson design canvas for AP CSA topics.\n",
    "**Examples**: Show a ‚Äúflat‚Äù lesson vs. a designed LxD lesson for the same AP CSA concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Assessment\n",
    "**Formative**: Checkpoints during outline creation.\n",
    "**Summative**: Completed LxD lesson plan for an AP CSA topic.\n",
    "**Reflection**: Written statement on design choices and alignment to LxD pillars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Extension / Homework\n",
    "- Take another AP CSA topic (e.g., recursion) and create an LxD lesson from scratch.\n",
    "- **Optional**: Build interactive component as a runnable Java snippet or web-based code example."
