    "## 📚 Project-based Learning Strategies \n",
    "Each sprint will include hacks and project-based learning requirements. It is up to each individual to develop their own plan for representing their work. Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All graded work and accompanying tangible artifacts will be captured in a personal GitHub Issue and ultimately progress to a GitHub Pages Blog\n",
    "- - To obtain clarity on instructions, start with understanding words, explore and imagine (talk to people), ideate (talk to people, use sticky notes idea board, draw some Canva pictures), and then tinker (work with pair, make a page or Jupyter Notebook). Build relationships through work with peers, then ask questions of other Computer Science students from the same or different classes, and then ask questions or show ideas to the Teacher or TA, repeat, repeat, repeat.\n",
    "- As you go through these efforts, you will map tasks and processes to development methodologies (e.g., LxD, backwards design or UbD, Agile), and ultimately Deploy page(s) and fulfill assessment requirements (tangible artifacts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Verbs\n",
    "\n",
    "In Education, there is a framework called **Bloom's Taxonomy** which represents the standards for learning. We will use these levels to guide your technical evaluation for this Sprint:\n",
    "  - **📝 Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts about tools and commands\n",
    "  - **💡 Understand** - Explain how tools work and their purpose in development workflow  \n",
    "  - **⚙️ Apply** - Perform basic setup, installation, and coding tasks\n",
    "  - **🔍 Analyze** - Troubleshoot problems by examining logs, error messages, and system behavior\n",
    "  - **📊 Evaluate** - Assess and correct errors, compare solutions, and make correct tool choices; peer review others' work\n",
    "  - **🎨 Create** - Produce original code, customize configurations, and add to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally in Education there are the 4C's which highlight key skills that every educator wants for their students to acquire.\n",
    "  - **Communication** - this is not only verbal but is in our abilities to express what we are learning.\n",
    "  - **Collaborate** - communication about work and taking action together on a task is collaboration.\n",
    "  - **Critical-Thinking** - a path of taking an idea and through cognition and work solving the tough problems.\n",
    "  - **Creativity** - perhaps the hardest of all, making a useful solution out of many unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not tasks, but are \"soft skills\" that are in higher demand than the more task-oriented \"hard skills\" like coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Connection to Your Classroom:** The 4C's seamlessly integrate with your Hyperflex approach - students communicate through GitHub developer tools, collaborate as Agile teams with Kanban boards, think critically through debugging and problem-solving, and create through iterative project development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementing all your creative actions by establishing a Software Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a key focus for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![sdl]({{site.baseurl}}/images/sdl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **How These Frameworks Connect**\n",
    "Your journey follows this integrated path:\n",
    "1. **Start** → Use Design Thinking to empathize and define problems\n",
    "2. **Build** → Apply Agile methods (Plan → Code → Deploy → Iterate)\n",
    "3. **Reflect** → Document in your plans and portfolio for continuous improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### User/Learning Experience Design (UxD, LxD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing what to do is one of the greatest barriers to coding. It is said that **embracing discomfort** is often a prerequisite for growth, creativity, and ultimately, a more profound sense of **joy or fulfillment**. Design and coding will stir these emotions. In our design, we will be learning how to use tools and code by providing an experience to learn tools and code:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Constraints** - Certain tools and frameworks are being provided and are relevant to our year-long projects: VSCode, GitHub, GitHub Pages, JavaScript, Python/Flask, Java/Spring, Jupyter Notebooks. As designers, you will need to provide solutions that are complementary.\n",
    "  - **Design Verbs** - Behaviorist (motivation, points), Cognitivist (organization, chunking), Constructivist (create, project learning), Connectivist (gamify, videos)\n",
    "  - **Hack Starters** - You will be given a library of code and specific lesson areas to start with; these are called Hacks. The provided constraints, GitHub Pages and GitHub, are modern tools and frameworks that can support the management of code, building a website, and presenting content. Inside the provided content, there is material spanning multiple years that students have used to support their previous Hacks. As a designer and coder, we are asking you to look at and reshape this information to be modern for our class and cohort.\n",
    "  - **Backward Design** - As you design a learning experience, it is often best to think backward: 1. outcome, what does the learner need to do? 2. assessment, how can we determine if the learner has obtained mastery? 3. instruction, **imagining** how the learner be instructed and how the learning design provides **thoughtful transfer** that **engages the learner**?\n",
    "  - **Design Thinking** - A common methodology for design. In this project, empathy and define have already started. You are picking up with the ideate phase, but that does not mean empathy and define could not be revisited. Usually ideate starts with sticky notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "  Empathy → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test\n",
    "     ↑        ↑        ↑          ↑         ↓\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Process Verbs and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Scrum Agile Development** methodology, which we will learn throughout the course, the focus is on delivery, iteration, and management (plans, designs, code, test, review, deploy, and continuous improvement). We will use these principles to guide your soft skills evaluation for this Sprint:\n",

    "### Assessment Definition and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Self-management** - Taking ownership of your learning\n",
    "  - **Incremental progression** - Building skills step by step\n",
    "  - **Self-organization** - Managing your time and priorities\n",
    "  - **Iterative techniques** - Refining work through cycles\n",
    "  - **Continuous delivery** - Consistently producing and maintaining quality work\n",
    "  - **Tangible artifacts** - Code, Issues, Commit Histories, Demos, Draw.io Diagrams, Pictures, Videos, Planning/Scrum Boards, README files\n",
    "  - **Personal Portfolio** - Jupyter Notebooks, Posts, Tinker experiences, Hack creations, Debug Sessions, Test Results, Sprint summaries \n",

    " **💡 Key Points:**\n",
    "> - There are very few \"correct answers\" or \"wrong answers\" in this class! As you design code, you will see there are always more improvements and mistakes to be made, features and bugs to work on\n",
    "> - Those who achieve high grades typically engage in work that interests them, talk frequently in class about work with peers, and learn to be comfortable sharing both successes and mistakes.\n",
    "> - You will earn points if you can \"show\" that you are progressing on your Computer Science journey - the  key objective checklist and evaluation checklist below helps form those habits; as a behaviorist designer, you even have the opportunity to make up points\n",
    "> - BTW, Corporations in America are paying insane amounts of money to those who improve and expedite their work with AI usage, read about META\n",
    "> - **Junior Developer: $85,000+ | Scrum Master: $110,000+ | Senior Developer: $120,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer: $150,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer/Manager: $250,000++**\n",
    "> - **The highest-paid roles require both coding AND people skills - just like what we practice in this classroom!**\n",
    "> - **More than the money, it provides satisfaction to get out of your shell and \"create\"**\n",

    "### 🚧 Common Learning Obstacles & Solutions\n",
    "Turn all these common fears from negatives to positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"I don't know where to start\"** → Begin with the Imagine phase - talk to 3 people about the problem\n",
    "- **\"This is too overwhelming\"** → Use Chunking - break into smaller pieces using Design Verbs\n",
    "- **\"I'm not good at this\"** → Remember: Discomfort = Growth. Document your learning journey.\n",

    "1. Provides several alternative designs for notebooks and pages\n",
    "2. Contains instruction and examples for the requested hacks\n",
    "3. Includes introductions to tools and processes (Scrum Agile), which are commonly found on the Internet and through AI\n",
    "\n",
    "But in order to reach the \"create\" level, you will need a plan to improve upon \"pages\" and re-organize content and files into your own team repository.
