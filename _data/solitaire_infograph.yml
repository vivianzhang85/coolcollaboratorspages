    link: "/solitaire/lesson/frontend"
    alt: "Frontend Interaction"
    keyPoints:
      - "Click and drag cards"
      - "Understand rules through interaction"
      - "Gain feedback visually"
    subtitle: "User Interface Basics"
    description: "Players build interaction skills by moving cards across piles. This mirrors how frontend interfaces teach users to work with drag, drop, and click-based systems."

  - title: "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts"

    link: "/solitaire/lesson/oop"
    alt: "OOP Concepts"
    keyPoints:
      - "Cards as objects"
      - "Piles as collections"
      - "Rules as class methods"
      - "Inheritance and reuse"
    subtitle: "Programming Mindset"
    description: "Each card and pile in Solitaire represents an object. Through play, students can connect OOP concepts like classes, methods, and inheritance to real actions in the game."

  - title: "Problem-Solving and Algorithmic Thinking"

    alt: "Problem Solving"
    keyPoints:
      - "Plan moves ahead"
      - "Uncover hidden cards"
      - "Optimize decisions"
      - "Apply logical steps"
    subtitle: "Strategic Thinking"
    description: "Solitaire encourages algorithmic reasoning. Players analyze options, plan sequences of moves, and apply logical thinkingâ€”the same steps used in coding and algorithm design."
