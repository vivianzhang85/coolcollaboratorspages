    "## One of the most important concepts to understand in Javascript is how it handles synchronous and asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default Behavior in Javascript is Synchronous**\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript runs code line by line, in order. This is known as synchronous execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of synchronous behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(\"One\");\\\n",
    "console.log(\"Two\");\\\n",
    "console.log(\"Three\");\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output:*\n",
    "\n",
    "One\\\n",
    "Two\\\n",
    "Three\n",
    "\n",
    "**This works great — until you hit time-consuming tasks like:**\n",
    "1. Fetching data from a server\n",
    "2. Reading files\n",
    "3. Waiting for timers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, if we use synchronous code it will block everything else until the task is done — and user experience will suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter Asynchronous JavaScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous operations allow JavaScript to move on to other tasks while waiting for something (like a network request) to finish.\n",
    "JavaScript achieves this using tools like:\n",
    "* setTimeout()\n",
    "* async/await\n",
    "* Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "* The network request completes. The fetchTodo() function resumes its execution, and the next await keyword processes the response as JSON.\n",
