## GitHub Pages Hacks

Enhance or update your GitHub Pages using your new knowledge from Previous Hacks.

- Alter `index.md` with images and links according to some of your personal interests or projects.
- Make your `index.md` contain a guide that points to several Notebooks.
- Make one of the Notebooks a planning document on what you attempted to do versus what you accomplished.
- Make one of the Notebooks run a JavaScript cell.
- Make one of the Notebooks an About Page.

## Navigation Style

Create your own navigation style. Bonus: Let users pick their preferred navigation style using a toggle or menu.

- Use Mermaid diagrams, HTML tables, or Markdown lists to organize and link your project’s key pages (such as Notebooks, About, and Blog).
- Compare at least two navigation styles in your project.
- Ask peers for feedback on which style is most user-friendly.

## Jekyll Hack

Use layout to enhance your navigation style.

- **Alter the appearance of the blogs:** Modify the layout, style, or content of your blog posts to reflect your personal taste.
- **Info Graphic:** Use an infographic approach like tools to build your series of lessons.

## Understanding `_config.yml`

The `_config.yml` file is the heart of your GitHub Pages site configuration. It controls site-wide settings such as the title, description, theme, navigation, and more.

**Explore and Try:**

- Open your project’s `_config.yml` file.
- Find and edit the following settings:
  - `title`: The name of your site (appears in the browser tab and header).
  - `description`: A short summary of your site’s purpose.
  - `theme`: The Jekyll theme your site uses.
  - `url` and `baseurl`: Used for correct link generation.
- Add a new custom variable (for example, `author: Your Name`) and display it in your layout or a page using `{{ site.author }}`.

**Challenge:**  

- Change the site title and description, then run your site locally to see the changes.
- Try adding a new navigation link or menu item by editing `_config.yml`.
- Research other options you can set in `_config.yml` to customize your site.

> Understanding and customizing `_config.yml` is key to making your GitHub Pages site truly your own!

## Utterances Hacks

- Set up your blogs for direct feedback using Utterances.
- Get two other people to mutually share work.
- Each should evaluate how many things were accomplished versus what was asked.
