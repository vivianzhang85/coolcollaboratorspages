### What Is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It's a set of rules that lets two software programs talk to each other.

### Simple Definition:
An API is like a menu in a restaurant. The menu shows you what you can order (the endpoints).You don‚Äôt need to know how the kitchen works ‚Äî you just order.
The kitchen prepares your food and sends it back.

In tech terms: You (frontend or Postman) send a request to the API. The backend (Flask, Django, Node, etc.) handles it and responds with data.

| Example Task                | API Being Used                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Check weather on your phone | Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)       |
| Log in to a website         | Authentication API                       |
| Use Google Maps in an app   | Google Maps API                          |
| Submit a form on a website  | Custom backend API (like your Flask app) |


‚úÖ Where to Add New Functionality (Like a Weather API Call)
Let‚Äôs say you want to add a new /weather route that calls an external weather API.

üìå You should add this logic to:
/api/weather.py ‚Äì create this new file if it doesn't exist yet.

Then, define your route inside that file:

~~~
# /api/weather.py

import requests
from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify

weather_api = Blueprint('weather_api', __name__)
API_KEY = 'abcd1234apikey'

@weather_api.route('/weather', methods=['GET'])
def get_weather():
    city = request.args.get('city', 'San Diego')
    url = f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric'
    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        return {'error': 'API request failed'}, response.status_code

    data = response.json()
    return jsonify({
        'city': city,
        'temperature': data['main']['temp'],
        'description': data['weather'][0]['description']
    })
~~~
üß† Notes:
External API logic goes into api/, not models/ (because you're not storing or managing your own database table for this data).

Use a Blueprint so it plugs into the rest of the app cleanly.

‚öôÔ∏è Don‚Äôt Forget to Register the Route
Open your __init__.py and import/register your new Blueprint:

~~~
# __init__.py
from flask import Flask
from api.weather import weather_api  # üëà import your new route

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Register blueprints
    app.register_blueprint(weather_api)

    return app
~~~
