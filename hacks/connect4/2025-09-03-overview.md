# ðŸŽ¯ Connect 4 Overview

Welcome! In this section, you'll learn what skills Connect 4 teaches through hands-on game development.

## What You'll Build

A complete Connect 4 game that demonstrates essential programming concepts:

### Core Skills You'll Master

**State Management**
- Board representation using 2D arrays
- Player turn tracking and coin management  
- Timer system with real-time updates
- Game lifecycle (start, play, win, restart)

**Responsive UI Development**
- CSS Grid for 6Ã—7 game board layout
- Dynamic DOM manipulation and updates
- Smooth animations for falling pieces
- Mobile-responsive design patterns

**Algorithm Implementation** 
- Gravity simulation for piece placement
- Win detection across 4 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonals)
- Input validation and error handling
- Game state transitions

**Object-Oriented Programming**
- Class design with single responsibility principle
- Encapsulation of game logic and data
- Clean separation between UI and game logic
- Modular, testable code architecture

## Learning Path

This Connect 4 project is structured as a progressive learning experience:

1. **Overview** (this lesson) - Understand the big picture
2. **OOP** - Organize code with classes and objects  
3. **Algorithms** - Implement game logic and win detection
4. **Challenges** - Add advanced features like undo, persistence, and AI

## Why Connect 4?

Connect 4 is the perfect learning project because it:
- Combines familiar game rules with programming fundamentals
- Requires both logical thinking and visual design
- Scales from simple concepts to advanced features
- Teaches skills you'll use in larger applications

## What's Next

Ready to dive in? The next lesson covers Object-Oriented Programming - you'll learn how to structure your code using classes that make the game logic clean, testable, and easy to extend.
