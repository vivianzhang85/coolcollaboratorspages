## Why Backend Tools Matter

Frontend design may catch the eye, but backend tools are the engine that drive web applications. With frameworks like Flask, testing platforms like Postman, and interfaces to monitor and manage data, you’ll be equipped to build, debug, and scale full-stack solutions. These tools are not only foundational for this class—they're industry standards that will prepare you for internships, projects, and beyond.
