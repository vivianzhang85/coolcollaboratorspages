    "\n",
    "**Here's what makes this different:** Instead of just surviving the onboarding process, you'll be redesigning it. Every frustration you experience, every breakthrough you have, and every solution you create becomes valuable data for improving the journey for 200+ students who follow year after year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are a Learning Experience Designer** using professional LxD methods and Design Thinking to:\n",
    "- Transform your learning struggles into design insights\n",
    "- Build training resources that actually work\n",
    "- Leave a legacy that helps hundreds of future students succeed\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't just coursework — it's real impact work that mirrors what LxD professionals do at education technology companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "New students often feel overwhelmed in their first weeks: new tools, unfamiliar workflows, and unclear expectations. Your job is to reduce this friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "By the end of this sprint, you will:\n",
    "- Build Sites. Have your own team and individual GitHub Pages site online.\n",
    "- Master Tools. Be familiar with our essential development tools.\n",
    "- Improve Content. Contribute one improvement to the onboarding content.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Remember:** You are both a **learner** and a **designer** in this sprint. Everything you experience as a new student is insight you can turn into a better onboarding process for the next class. A key skill in LxD and Design Thinking is understanding and empathizing with the learner so you can define and ideate improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into tools and code, let’s tap into knowledge you already have. Even without programming experience, you’ve worked with ideas that will help you succeed as a Learning Experience Designer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Learning Concepts\n",
    "You’ve likely used:\n",
    "- **Rubrics** – scoring guides that set clear expectations.  \n",
    "- **Checklists** – step-by-step task trackers to ensure nothing gets missed.  \n",
    "- **Assessments** – quizzes, reflections, or projects used to measure progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard:\n",
    "- **Action verbs (Bloom’s)** – words that describe different levels of thinking.j\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **📝 Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts about tools and commands\n",
    "  - **💡 Understand** - Explain how tools work and their purpose in development workflow  \n",
    "  - **⚙️ Apply** - Perform basic setup, installation, and coding tasks\n",
    "  - **🔍 Analyze** - Troubleshoot problems by examining logs, error messages, and system behavior\n",
    "  - **📊 Evaluate** - Assess and correct errors, compare solutions, and make correct tool choices; peer review others' work\n",
    "  - **🎨 Create** - Produce original code, customize configurations, and add to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably familiar with team words:\n",
    "- **The 4C’s** – skills often discussed among teachers, which make teams stronger and projects more effective.\n",
    "  - **Communication** - this is not only verbal but is in our abilities to express what we are learning.\n",
    "  - **Collaborate** - communication about work and taking action together on a task is collaboration.\n",
    "  - **Critical-Thinking** - a path of taking an idea and through cognition and work solving the tough problems.\n",
    "  - **Creativity** - perhaps the hardest of all, making a useful solution out of many unknowns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",

    "You've spent over a decade experiencing learning design from the student perspective. Through **25+ teachers**, countless assignments, and various learning challenges, you've developed an intuitive understanding of what makes learning effective—and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This experience makes you uniquely qualified to become a Learning Experience Designer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Hidden LxD Expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you've thought *\"I wish my teacher had explained it this way\"* or *\"This assignment would be better if...\"* — that's **Learning Experience Design thinking** in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a Student, You Already Know:**\n",
    "- **What confuses learners** → You've been confused and found clarity\n",
    "- **How instructions should flow** → You've followed good and bad directions  \n",
    "- **When feedback helps vs. hurts** → You've experienced both motivating and discouraging responses\n",
    "- **What makes teams work** → You've been in groups that clicked and others that struggled\n",
    "- **How to recognize your learning style** → You know when you're engaged vs. when you're lost\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a Future LxD Professional, you'll apply this by Design Thinking**\n",
    "- **Designing with empathy** → Drawing on your frustrations to create better experiences\n",
    "- **Writing clear POV descriptions** → Using your confusion points to guide clarity *(Point of View statements that define user needs)*\n",
    "- **Building effective HMW team activities** → Designing collaboration that actually works to solve problems *(How Might We questions that spark ideation)*\n",
    "- **Prototyping learning journeys** → Helping others see their potential growth path through early design elements\n",
    "- **Testing and refining based on feedback** → Listening to critique while remembering what encouragement felt like\n",
