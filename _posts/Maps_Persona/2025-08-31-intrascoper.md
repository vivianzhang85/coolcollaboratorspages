bio: >
  I am a driven CS student who enjoys individual work and tackling the hardest technical challenges. I am motivated by mastery and recognition, and often surprise others with exceptional problem-solving skills. I excel in individual assignments and competitions, but group work can be frustrating, especially when team members are less focused on code or schedules are unclear.  Building trust and communication with peers is an ongoing challenge, but when I am engaged, I can elevate the whole project.

    This persona prefers individual work, is skeptical of teamwork, but surprises others with cognitive excellence when engaged. Often, this person will take on the hardest challenges in a technical project, but can try team members’ nerves as they often schedule poorly.

    - "Look at this new feature I created."
    - "I just want to ask you and be sure to get it right."

    - "Can loop or get frustrated on materials they have not been able to grasp, sometimes compounded by not reaching out to peers early"
