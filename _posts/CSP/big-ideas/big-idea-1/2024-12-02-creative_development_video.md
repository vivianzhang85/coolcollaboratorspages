## Make a Video as a Team

Teaching will be conducted by in person segements and video play.  Use guidelines below to create lesson..

### Teaching Requirements

Often teaching have a plan for how to involve learners.  I suggest using Merrill's Five Principles of instruction.

1. Problem Centered.  Learning is most effective when it is centered on real-world problems or tasks that learners need or want to solve.
2. Activation.  Connect new information to what the learner already knows. Tell them why they can do this.
3. Demonstration.  Share new knowledge and skills to the learner.  
4. Application.  Learners practice (popcorn hacks) and then refine their skills, often through homework (hacks) that encourage learning from their mistakes.
5. Integration. After completing application, provide guideance on where the skills will come into play in the future.

Timing

* 20 minutes Lecture time using video and popcorns hacks.
* 20 minutes Application time where learning completes homework.
* 20 minutes Inegration time where learner submits work for grading.

### Video Requirements

Video submission to College Board is a key element in their testing.

A series of well prepared one minute segments within the video prepared video can help guide the discussion and allow learner opportunity for review and replay.

1. Make sure video has clear division transition pages.
2. The video should support introducing Problem, Activation, and Demostration.
3. Be sure each member of Agile Team is involved in at least 1 segment.  
4. Edit video effectively and try to keep it under 5 minutes.

## Big Idea 1

As you build your application, lesson, and video consider all of the  College Board learning requirements described below.  Consider these outlines will help you become "Agile", make your "Content" more interesting, and improve on "LxD" skills.

### Collaboration Review

It is a common belief in industry that collaboration is one of the key skills of a Software Engineer.  Simple activities like think-pair-share, scrum agile methodolgoy, and making and reviewing plans are consider fundamental in speeding up the development life cycle.  An Agile mindset and checking in with other often is fundamental.  Remember, "collaboration" is the 1st topic in AP Classroom, first usually means important.

- [ ] What are the benefits of a team?  Explain some of the diveristies that your team has to offer.
- [ ] Describe how you will facilitate communication amongst group members.  Suggestion using scrum agile methodology.
- [ ] How will you hold each person accountable for their portion of the work?  Think about dates, review tickets, and peer reviews using a Kanban board.

### Program Function and Purpose

To "make" a program or teach a lessoon with function and purpose, you need to "plan" with function a purpose.  Build a Jupyter Notebook to show examples of the following from your project.

- [ ] Program with Output
- [ ] Program with Input and Output
- [ ] Program with a List
- [ ] Program with a Dictionary
- [ ] Program with Iteration
- [ ] Program with a Function to perform mathematical and/or a statistical calculations.
- [ ] Program with a Selection/Condition
- [ ] Finish with a Program with Purpose

### Program Design and Development

Share a notebook that you have expanded upon that was written by another, for instance changing a lesson, game, or hack.  Show extensive documentation on that program (ie use Copilot or ChatGPT for help).  Here are some minimum requirements for Design and Development documentation.

- [ ] Create a Visual Illustration of a program, algorithm, or process. Purpose, Point of View, and User stories can help.
- [ ] Show documentation of a program with a List and Iteration. GitHub can help.
- [ ] Show comments on a program, including something that does a mathematical and/or statistical calculation.

### Identyfing and Correct Errors

Often, when we develop code, the initial functionality is very simple.  However, when we consider invalid conditions when using our code we often increase the complexity of our code or functions.

- [ ] Create a tester function that runs a program that create data for testing.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that captures conditions if a user errors in input with if / else statements.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that handles error conditions in code if data or database fails, for example try / catch statements.
- [ ] Illustrate a debugging session using inspect in browser on frontend.
- [ ] Illustrate a debugging session that uses Postman and VS Code to debug backend.
