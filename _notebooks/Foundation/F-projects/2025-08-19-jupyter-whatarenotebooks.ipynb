    "## 1. What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that combines code, text, and output in a single file. It's made up of **cells** that can contain different types of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Types Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell 1 - Frontmatter (Metadata) [Raw Cell]**\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: Python Tic Tac Toe Game\n",
    "comments: false\n",
    "layout: post\n",
    "permalink: /games/tictactoe\n",
    "author: Mihir Bapat, Yash Parikh, Ansh Kumar\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw cells** contain plain text that isn't processed as code or markdown. Here, it contains **frontmatter** - special metadata that tells our website generator how to display this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell 2 - Documentation [Markdown Cell]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown cells** let you write formatted text, like this explanation. You can include headings, lists, links, and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'd typically explain what your code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell 3 - Code [Python Cell]**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_board(board): \n",
    "    print(\"\\n\") \n",
    "    print(\" \" + board[0] + \" | \" + board[1] + \" | \" + board[2]) \n",
    "    print(\"---+---+---\") \n",
    "    print(\" \" + board[3] + \" | \" + board[4] + \" | \" + board[5]) \n",
    "    print(\"---+---+---\") \n",
    "    print(\" \" + board[6] + \" | \" + board[7] + \" | \" + board[8]) \n",
    "    print(\"\\n\") \n",
    "\n",
    "# This is your actual tic-tac-toe game code!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code cells** contain executable Python code. When you run these cells, the output appears below them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How to Run the Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can execute our tic-tac-toe code, we need to set up our environment properly. **We'll be doing a live demo of this process!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Environment (venv):** You must be working inside a Python virtual environment that has all your required packages installed\n",
    "- **Kernel Selection:** In VS Code, select your venv kernel from the kernel picker in the top-right of the notebook\n",
    "- **Module Availability:** Modules like `nbconvert` must be installed in your selected venv to work properly\n",
    "- **Running Cells:** Use Shift+Enter or the play button to execute code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if you're in the right environment\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(f\"Python path: {sys.executable}\")\n",
    "# This should show your venv path, not system Python!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code cells aren't running or modules aren't found, check that you've selected the correct kernel that matches your virtual environment!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Understanding Frontmatter\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontmatter is metadata written in YAML format at the top of your notebook. It tells your website how to process and display the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What each frontmatter field means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **title:** The page title that appears in browsers and search results\n",
    "- **comments:** Whether to enable comments on the webpage (true/false)\n",
    "- **layout:** Which HTML template to use for styling the page\n",
    "- **permalink:** The custom URL path where the page will be accessible\n",
    "- **author:** Who created this content\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. From Notebook to Website\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how your Jupyter notebook becomes a live webpage using the **nbconvert** module:\n",
    "\n",
    "üìì **Jupyter Notebook** (Your .ipynb file with cells) ‚Üí üîÑ **nbconvert** (Processes and converts) ‚Üí üåê **Web Page** (HTML in _posts directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What nbconvert does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reads your notebook:** Parses the .ipynb file structure\n",
    "- **Processes frontmatter:** Extracts metadata for website generation\n",
    "- **Converts cells:** Turns code/markdown cells into HTML\n",
    "- **Applies styling:** Uses CSS to make it look good on the web\n",
    "- **Saves to _posts:** Places the HTML file where your website can find it\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Basic nbconvert command\n",
    "jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "# With custom template for your website\n",
    "jupyter nbconvert --to html --template=custom your_notebook.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. The Complete Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create notebook:** Write your tic-tac-toe game in Jupyter\n",
    "2. **Add frontmatter:** Include metadata in a raw cell\n",
    "3. **Run nbconvert:** Convert notebook to HTML\n",
    "4. **Website displays:** Your game appears at /games/tictactoe\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember these important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jupyter notebooks** combine code, documentation, and output in one file\n",
    "- **Frontmatter** provides metadata that controls how your page appears on the web\n",
    "- **nbconvert** is the bridge between notebooks and websites\n",
    "- **Cell types** (Raw, Markdown, Code) serve different purposes\n",
    "- **The _posts directory** is where your converted HTML files live"
