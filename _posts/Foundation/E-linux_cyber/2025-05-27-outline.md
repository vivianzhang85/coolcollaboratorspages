Linux Navigation Project
Introduce students to basic Linux commands through a game or challenge. For example, a "Capture the Flag" (CTF) scenario where students use commands like grep, find, or cat to uncover hidden clues.

Systems / Linux Interaction
Guide students in deploying a simple web application (like a static site or basic Flask app). Include setting up a server, configuring it (e.g., with Nginx or Apache), and ensuring itâ€™s secure. Leave some vulnerabilities for educational purposes:

No SSL

Default credentials

Open ports

Open file permissions

Open/unrestricted personal data and APIs

Cyber Defense - Attack and Protect Project
Introduce basic cybersecurity concepts by having students harden a system against simulated attacks. Use tools like Metasploit for controlled testing and require students to identify vulnerabilities, patch them, and write a report on their security measures.
