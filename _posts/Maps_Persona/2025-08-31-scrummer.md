bio: >
  I am a collaborative learner who grows through teamwork and iteration. I enjoy working in teams, contributing to group success, and learning from others. Seeing my team each day makes me happy and excited to solve problems together. While I thrive in Agile environments, I sometimes find it challenging to show my unique contributions and can be unsure how my individual work impacts my grade, especially when groupthink makes it easy to blend in with the team.
