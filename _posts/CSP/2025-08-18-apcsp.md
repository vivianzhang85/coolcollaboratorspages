# AP CSP Study Guide (with Real-World Applications)

A streamlined prep resource for the AP CSP exam — connecting **Big Ideas** directly to **software engineering practices** like Agile, full-stack development, CORS, licensing, and AWS deployment.  

---

## Exam Overview
- **Format**: 70 MCQ (70%), Create Task (30%)  
- **Skills**: Abstraction, Algorithms, Internet, Data, Global Impact  
- **Connection to Industry**: Exactly what you’ll see in **frontend/backend coding, APIs, and deploying apps on the cloud (AWS, GitHub Pages, etc.)**  

---

## Big Idea 1: Creative Development
- **Core Idea**: Programs are developed through collaboration, iteration, and abstraction.  
- **Real-World Link**: Agile methodology (sprints, stand-ups, pull requests) → teams push features to GitHub, review code, then deploy. Abstraction is used in APIs and frameworks so devs don’t reinvent everything.  

**MCQs**  
1. Which of the following best describes *abstraction*?  
- A) Exact binary code  
- B) Simplified representation of something complex  
- C) Hardware parts  
- D) A unique IP  

2. Why do Agile sprints help in creative development?  
- A) They eliminate testing  
- B) They enable iterative improvement and collaboration  
- C) They guarantee bug-free code  
- D) They prevent planning  

**FRQ**  
> Describe a time when you collaborated on a project (school, coding, or other). How did iteration or abstraction help?

## Big Idea 2: Data
- **Core Idea**: Data representation, compression, and analysis.  
- **Real-World Link**:  
  - Compression → faster web loads (JPEG, MP3).  
  - Logging & analytics → monitoring AWS deployments.  
  - Metadata (timestamps, IPs) → debugging production errors.  

**MCQs**  
1. Which is the *smallest* unit of digital data?  
- A) Byte  
- B) Bit  
- C) Kilobyte  
- D) Megabyte  

2. Why is metadata valuable in large datasets?  
- A) Prevents all errors  
- B) Provides context (time, source) for deeper analysis  
- C) Makes data unhackable  
- D) Always accurate  

**FRQ**  
> Suppose you are analyzing website traffic. Explain how compression and metadata might be used together to improve performance and understanding of user behavior.

## Big Idea 3: Algorithms & Programming
- **Core Idea**: Sequencing, selection, iteration, and efficiency.  
- **Real-World Link**:  
  - Backend APIs → search, sort, filter.  
  - Frontend → event-driven programming (buttons, forms).  
  - Efficiency → AWS bills you more if your algorithm is wasteful!  

**MCQs**  
1. Which is an algorithm?  
- A) Recipe steps for baking a cake  
- B) The oven  
- C) The flour  
- D) The flavor  

2. Which is an example of iteration?  
- A) Loop repeats until a condition is met  
- B) A single click action  
- C) One-time calculation  
- D) Static content  

**FRQ**  
> Write pseudocode for a simple program that asks a user for a number and prints whether it is even or odd.

## Big Idea 4: Computer Systems & Networks
- **Core Idea**: Protocols, reliability, cybersecurity.  
- **Real-World Link**:  
  - **CORS**: lets frontend JS safely call backend APIs.  
  - **HTTPS/TLS**: secure AWS-deployed apps.  
  - **Fault tolerance**: AWS load balancers keep sites up during crashes.  

**MCQs**  
1. Which protocol guarantees delivery of packets?  
- A) HTTP  
- B) TCP  
- C) DNS  
- D) IP  

2. Why are Internet protocols layered?  
- A) To allow independent systems to work together  
- B) To reduce abstraction  
- C) To make data less secure  
- D) To give one company control  

**FRQ**  
> Imagine your web app is not loading because of a CORS error. Explain what’s happening and one way to fix it.

## Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing
- **Core Idea**: Computing has benefits + harms (ethics, bias, access).  
- **Real-World Link**:  
  - **Licenses**: MIT vs GPL decide how others use your open-source code.  
  - **Digital divide**: unequal Internet access → AWS hosting can help reach global users, but still requires broadband.  
  - **Bias**: ML models can discriminate → important for full-stack apps that use AI.  

**MCQs**  
1. Which shows the digital divide?  
- A) Rural student lacks reliable internet  
- B) A file saved in multiple formats  
- C) App with frequent updates  
- D) A program written in two languages  

2. Which is bias in computing?  
- A) AI produces unfair results for some groups  
- B) A website compresses images  
- C) A database has millions of records  
- D) An app translates text correctly  

**FRQ**  
> Discuss one positive and one negative impact of open-source software licenses (like MIT or GPL) on innovation.

## Exam Day Tips
- Use the **pseudocode sheet** (provided).  
- Think about **efficiency, abstraction, and impact**.  
- Connect CSP concepts → **deployment**:  
  - Agile → teamwork  
  - Data → analytics  
  - Algorithms → backend/frontend  
  - Networks → CORS + HTTPS  
  - Impacts → licenses, access, ethics
