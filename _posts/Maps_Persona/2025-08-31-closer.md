bio: >
  I am a detail-oriented CS student who thrives on completing tasks and meeting milestones. I feel most confident when requirements are clear and feedback is available, and I take pride in finishing work efficiently. While I excel in structured environments, I may hesitate or feel anxious with open-ended assignments. Seeking confirmation from teachers or peers helps me stay on track and achieve success.
