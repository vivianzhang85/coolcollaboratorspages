# Steps
- First, you should log in to your account [here](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/login)
- You need to log in to make sure the database knows which user to connect your stats to. If you don't have a user, the database wont know who owns the stats and you wont be able to retrieve them. 
- Change the gname variable in the Game.js to what you want your game to be called. When you call the createStats() function, it will add your game to the database.

# Methods
> There are 3 methods you will be able to use to manage the stats within your game:
1. GET
2. POST
3. UPDATE

* If you take AP CSP, these are the most commonly used HTTP methods in CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) so you should get familiar with them. However, for now you will just be using them. 

## GET
- Used to retrieve data from a server. Think of this of asking the database for your stats. 

> Here is the template of a GET request that you can locate in your Game.js file. Remember, the GET request returns a JSON of your stats

```js
    static async getStats(personId) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.javaURI}/getStats/${personId}`, {
                method: "GET",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                }
            });
    
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
            }
    
            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error fetching stats:", error);
            return "Error fetching stats";
        }
    }
```

## POST
- Used to send data to the server to create a new resource. This is how you add yourself to the be stored in the database initially. 

```js
    static async createStats(content, questionId, personId) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.javaURI}/createStats`, {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    uid: personId,
                    gid: questionId,
                    stats: content
                })
            });
    
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
            }
    
            const data = await response.json();
            return data; // returns the stats JSON
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error creating stats:", error);
            return "Error creating stats";
        }
    }
```

## UPDATE
- Used to update or replace an existing resource. You are basically updating your stats 

```js
    static async updateStats(content, questionId, personId) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.javaURI}/updateStats`, {
                method: "PUT",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    uid: personId,
                    gid: questionId,
                    stats: content
                })
            });
    
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
            }
    
            const data = await response.json();
            return data; 
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error updating stats:", error);
            return "Error updating stats";
        }
    }
```
